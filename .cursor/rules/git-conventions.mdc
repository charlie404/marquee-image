## Git Commit Messages
When generating commit messages, always follow these rules:
- Write all commit messages in English
- Use conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`
- Available types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- Keep the first line under 50 characters
- Use imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Provide brief explanation in commit body if needed

Examples:
- `feat: add reverse prop for animation direction`
- `fix: resolve positioning bug in mobile view`
- `docs: update README with new examples`
- `refactor: optimize canvas drawing performance`

## Code Style for Web Components
- Use modern JavaScript ES6+ features
- Follow web component best practices
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful variable names
- Export default class for proper imports
